# Hao-Yun-Fu-Yuan

After the update of Onmioji on 2023-02-01, an interesting little activity called "Hao Yun Fu Yuan" was launched.

Its rules are as follows:
Three players participate, grab 1~5 yuan xiao in turn, and the player who gets the last yuan xiao wins.

This is a very fascinating complete information game problem, and is similar to Bash Game. I did some simple program simulation on it.
